# Frontend Mentor - IP Address Tracker

![Design preview for the IP Address Tracker coding challenge](./src/images/preview-image.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This project uses a geolocation API called [https://geoiplookup.io/](GeoIPLookup.io) to find key information plus latitude and longitude coordinates which is then used to show the location using Google Maps API.

This was a fun project to make and great for refreshing on React.js. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## To run on your local machine:

1. Create a ".env" file in the root directory with the following line of text:
`REACT_APP_GOOGLE_API_KEY=[Google maps API Key]`
Replace `[Google maps API Key]` with your own Google Maps API Key

2. Install project dependencies:
`npm install`

3. The following scripts are available to run:

### `yarn start` or `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test` or `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build` or `npm build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject` or `npm eject`
